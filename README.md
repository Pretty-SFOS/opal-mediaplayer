# MediaPlayer

QML module for adding media player views to Sailfish apps

This module provides a media player page with support for subtitles.


## Status

The module is already usable but the code is still extremely messy and undocumented.
However, as the module is based on Leszek Lesner's [video player for SailfishOS](https://github.com/llelectronics/videoPlayer)
it can be considered quite mature.


## Usage

Put this in `MyVideoPlayer.qml`:

```{qml}
import QtQuick 2.0
import Sailfish.Silica 1.0
import Opal.MediaPlayer 1.0

VideoPlayerPage {
    autoplay: false
    mprisAppId: "My App"
    path: "/path/to/my/video.mp4"
    title: "My Video"
}
```

Then call this from somewhere in your app:

```{qml}
pageStack.push("MyVideoPlayer.qml")
```

## Permissions

Some permissions are required for this module to work in Sailjail. This only
affects apps intended for the Harbour store that show local video files.

Add this to your `harbour-my-app.desktop` file:

```{ini}
[X-Sailjail]
Permissions=Videos;MediaIndexing
```

See [here](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions#permissions) for
a list of all Sailjail permissions.

## Screenshots

Screenshots can be found in the [doc](doc/) directory.

## How to use

You do not need to clone this repository if you only intend to use the module in
another project. Simply download the latest release bundle from the "Releases" page.

### Setup

Follow the main documentation for installing Opal modules
[here](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal/blob/main/README.md#using-opal).

### Configuration

See [`doc/gallery.qml`](doc/gallery.qml) for an example. Read the file to get
started.

### Documentation

Documentation is included in the release bundle and can be added to
QtCreator via Extras → Settings → Help → Documentation → Add.

## Translations

To **use** packaged translations in your project, follow the main documentation for
using Opal modules [here](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal#using-opal).

You can also **contribute** translations. If an app uses Opal modules, consider
updating its translations at the source (i.e. here), so that all Opal users can
benefit from it. Translations are managed using
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/opal).

Please prefer Weblate over pull requests (which are still welcome, of course).
If you just found a minor problem, you can also
[leave a comment in the forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/opal-qml-components-for-app-development/15801)
or [open an issue](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal/issues/new).

Please include the following details:

1. the language you were using
2. where you found the error
3. the incorrect text
4. the correct translation

See [the Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html#details) for
details on how to translate date formats to your local format.
